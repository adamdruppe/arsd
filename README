This is a collection of modules I find generally useful.

Modules are usually independent; you don't need this whole directory
but it doesn't hurt to grab it all either.

Read more about the modules at these links (docs are still works in process):

cgi.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/cgi.d.html
web.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/web.d.html


Recent bigger changes:
	web.d can now accept file uploads via hackish thing - make a param with type "Cgi.UploadedFile"

Currently included are:

Web related
================

cgi.d  - base module for making webapps in D
dom.d  - an xml/html DOM based on what Javascript provides in browsers
web.d  - a fancier way to write web apps. Uses reflection to make functions
         accessible via url with minimal boilerplate in your code

web.d.php - a PHP library meant to ease integration of php components
	    with web.d apps. Gives (read) access to the session, and full
	    access to your D ApiProviders.

Database related
================

database.d  - main interface to databases. Includes DataObject
mysql.d     - a mysql engine for database.d (most mature of the three)
postgres.d  - a postgres engne for database.d
sqlite.d    - a sqlite engine for database.d
mssql.d     - a (super crappy) mssql engine for database.d (uses ODBC)

Desktop app stuff
================

simpledisplay.d - gives quick and easy access to a window for drawing
simpleaudio.d - gives minimal audio output

Other
================

sha.d  - implementations of the SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms
png.d  - provides some png read/write support
curl.d - a small wrapper around the curl library
csv.d  - gives read support to csv files
http.d - a lighterweight alternative to curl.d

color.d - a basic color struct and some HSL functions



Things I might add once I clean up the files (this can be expedited upon
request, to an extent):

httpd.d - an embedded web server
oauth.d - client/server stuff for oauth1
html.d  - a bunch of dom translation functions. Think unobstructive javascript
          on the server side
browser.d - a very small html widget
netman.d - handles net connections  (required by httpd.d)
imagedraft.d - (temporary name) has algorithms for images
bmp.d   - gives .bmp read/write
dws.d  - a draft of my D windowing system (also includes some Qt code)
wav.d  - reading and writing WAV files
midi.d - reading and writing MIDI files
