/**
	This module is obsolete. Its functionality has been merged
	into simpledisplay.d. You can use it instead and abandon this.


	Old stuff follows:

This module is a bunch of helper functions for dealing with X11
windows on top of simpledisplay.d

It is mostly about the atoms that communicate stuff to things like
window managers and taskbars.

The eventual goal is for this to be useful for writing those and for
writing plain applications.
